                        When Mexican hotelier, Alberto Del Rio, founded the 
                        Imperial Palace in 1998, he redefined the European 
                        restaurant scene and paved the way for a new style 
                        of modern hospitality, conceived on a simple 
                        premise: ‘doing normal things in an extraordinary manner’. <br><br>

                        A visionary of his time, Prager created a restaurant 
                        concept based on simplicity, innovation, commitment to 
                        service and a passion for culinary and hospitality excellence, 
                        and the rest, as they say, is history. <br><br>
